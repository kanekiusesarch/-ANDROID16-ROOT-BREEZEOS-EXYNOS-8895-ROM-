# -ANDROID16-ROOT-BREEZEOS-EXYNOS-8895-ROM-
a rooted android 16 rom built for exynos 8895 devices such as the samsung galaxy s8 s8+ note 8

once again ive found a rom thats android 16 and kernel rooted for the s8+ BUT DISCLAIMER ive expirinced lag+way WAY more software reboots then in the evoluiton x rom i released here.

also take note this ISNT my rom the gsi is unkown who made it but [telegram] @thewinner02 made this base and @JIeMoHuCHuKeT made the brightness fix.

this rom also has the same fixes as the one form evo x but here the cam does work on many of the devices.

[BUGS]
No blur [hard to figure out why]
android 15 quick settings [it was orginaly based on android 15 and the makers like forgot this.]
SOFT REBOOTS [on god this has gotta be just the most soft boot rom there is.]
brightness [can be fixed with the ksu modules included.]
wifi [this is a twrp flashable zip not a ksu module! flash this like the rom!}
[INSTALATION]
boot into twrp [THIS NEXT PART WHAT IM GONNA SAY ONLY IS NEEDED FOR PPL WHO ARE FLASHING THEIR FIRST ROM BUT CAN ALWAYS BE DONE IF SMTH GOES WRONG]
format the data then go to advanced wipe then change the filesystem of the /DATA partiton to f2fs[THIS IS WHAT I MEANT]
flash the repartioner then let it reboot then flahs the cleaner.
boot into twrp if it rebooted 
flash the rom 
just reboot the system end enjoy 

[NOTES]
IT CAN BOOTLOOP after you installed it so flash the rom again 
and im finding it very very unstable 
it softreboots after you uninstall a app 
and if your brightness is flickering when your using it then just disable adaptive brightness.


[THIS IS NOT MINE]
id be happy to help with problems ofc
and other sheneigans
also i released this rom here cuz im anoyed myself by ppl making roms yet never really publicy releasing it or does it but its super duper hard to find them and there are amazing devs making roms yet not many use them cuz ppl cant find them easy on the clearnet and its mostly in some kind of telegram group.

be sure to have fun with this rom if not get the evolution x rom i published here
